# Card-Game---Hawk-Eye-Innovations
My submission for the Card Game Coding task for Hawk-Eye Innovations Software Engineer Graduate Scheme.

# Project Overview
This project implements a Blackjack card game in two formats:
  - Python CLI Version - Command-line interface game suitable for quick testing and gameplay.
  - React GUI Version - Web-based interactive version with an engaging interface and animations.

This project demonstrates skils in OOP, state management, UI design and game logic implementation.
